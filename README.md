This catapult was made for a school project in my Arduino class. The entire project was made using parts from this kit on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZTLHGE?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details . The stepper motor chagnes the angle at which it launches. The servo motor spins the catapult arm (launches). The joystick reads two values which are mapped to output to the stepper and servo motor. The LCD screen displays the two values. The remote activates the launching sequence by pointing it at the receiver and pressing the power button.
